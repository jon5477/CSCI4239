How to compile:
The makefile is supplied for compiling the program. A simple "make" should suffice.

How to run:
The hw8 file is a shell script specific for running the program for Assignment 8.

Time taken to complete the assignment:
Approximately 4 hours. Most of the work put into this assignment was working on the shaders
to generate the lava-based perlin noise. Some of the shader code was taken from Example 18,
used specifically for generating the noise. The color interpolation was added to the base
shader code.
